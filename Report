The classes work as expected.
Make sure that binTree.h is in the same folder as map.h
The main.cpp has a main in it that acts as a test driver.


On the first turn in I forgot to check if a node existed before inserting,
insert with operator[], and remove my last == comparison. These were implemented
before I changed everything to the more modular design (2 seperate classes).
I hope you will accept these changes, but even if you don't, I want them there for
the sake of completeness.
